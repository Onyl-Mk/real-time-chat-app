üìù Description

This is a feature-rich, real-time mobile chat application built with React Native (Expo) and Firebase. This project demonstrates a full-stack mobile development approach, connecting a sleek, animated frontend to a powerful backend for live data synchronization.

The app features a complete user authentication system, editable user profiles with image uploads, private one-on-one conversations, and a dynamic chat list that displays the last message and unread notifications. The entire user interface is built with a modern, light-themed glassmorphism design for a polished and professional user experience.
‚ú® Key Features

    Real-Time Messaging: Utilizes Firebase Firestore's real-time listener to instantly deliver messages between users without needing to refresh.

    User Authentication: Secure user sign-up and login handled by Firebase Authentication, with persistent login sessions.

    Editable User Profiles: Users can edit their display name and upload a custom profile picture, which is stored in Firebase Storage.

    Private One-on-One Chats: A scalable database structure that supports private, one-on-one conversations between any two users on the platform.

    Dynamic Chat List: The main screen displays a list of all active conversations, sorted by the most recent message, and includes timestamps and unread message count badges.

    Modern Glassmorphism UI: A beautiful, light-themed "glass" design built with expo-blur for a modern, professional aesthetic.

    Smooth Animations: Message bubbles gracefully fade in and slide up using react-native-reanimated.

    "New Chat" Functionality: Users can browse a list of all registered users to start new conversations.
